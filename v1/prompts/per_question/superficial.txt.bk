Please help me analyze which students' responses are more superficial and list their responses.
To analyze which students' responses are more superficial, we can consider factors like:
Depth of explanation: Do they explain their reasoning clearly, or do they just repeat basic ideas from the study?
Application to the question: Do they directly address the quiz question, or do they give a vague or overly general response?
Originality: Are they simply restating the obvious conclusion, or do they offer any additional insight or personal reflection?
